# SwarmIntelligence
Swarm Intelligence (SI), first proposed by Benny and Wang in 1993 (Benny & Wang, 1993), is a population-based approach as a method for global optimization, mimicking animal behavior to search for food such as ants. , Cats, birds and so on. There are several reasons for the growing popularity of such SI-based algorithms, the most important of which is the reliability and adaptability provided by these algorithms. The ability of self-learning and adaptation to external changes are the main features provided by these algorithms, which has caused them to receive unparalleled attention.

In this course, many algorithms related on this topic, such as: Genetic Algorithms (GA) - Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) - Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) -  Grasshopper Optimization algorithm (GOA) - gravitational search algorithms - and many other algorithms Has been taught.
