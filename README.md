# SwarmIntelligence
Swarm Intelligence (SI), first proposed by Benny and Wang in 1993 (Benny & Wang, 1993), is a population-based approach as a method for global optimization, mimicking animal behavior to search for food such as ants. , Cats, birds and so on. There are several reasons for the growing popularity of such SI-based algorithms, the most important of which is the reliability and adaptability provided by these algorithms. The ability of self-learning and adaptation to external changes are the main features provided by these algorithms, which has caused them to receive unparalleled attention.

In this course, many algorithms related on this topic, such as: Genetic Algorithms (GA) - Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) - Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) -  Grasshopper Optimization algorithm (GOA) - gravitational search algorithms - and many other algorithms Has been taught. 

In this course, 2 projects have been done which are as follows:

1) HW1: The aim is to implement the article "An Efficient Genetic Algorithm for Maximizing Area Coverage in
Wireless Sensor Networks" using Genetic Algorithms (GA) to be able to cover the largest area with limited range of sensors.

The implementation article is also in the folder

2) HW2: The objective of this study is to select the appropriate features from some standard databases.
In this project, 4 algorithms "WHALE","SALP" , "GREYWOLF" and "GRASSHOPPER" are used in binary mode.

Obtaining the following parameters was important in this project:

_ Classification accuracy: it is gained by computing the average accuracy from 20 runs using the selected features on the test dataset.

_ Fitness values: they are gotten from each approach as stated. The mean, min (best), max(worst) and std fitness values are
compared.

_ Average selection size: is the average number of selected features.

_ Average execution time: is the run time for a given optimizer in seconds.
